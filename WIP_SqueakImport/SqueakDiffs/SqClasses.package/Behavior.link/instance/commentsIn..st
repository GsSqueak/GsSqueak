*SqClasses-accessing method dictionarycommentsIn: sourceString	"Return the comments as a collection of strings in sourceString. This method along with #nextQuotePosIn:startingFrom: is wrong, because it assumes that all double quote characters are comment delimiters, but even this method has a double quote which is not part of any method comment. Also this method has nothing to do with the Behavior itself. Probably CompiledMethod is the best place for this."		| commentStart nextQuotePos someComments aPos |	(sourceString includes: $") ifFalse: [^#()].	someComments:= OrderedCollection new.	aPos:=1.	nextQuotePos:= 0.	[commentStart := sourceString findString: '"' startingAt: aPos.	nextQuotePos:= self nextQuotePosIn: sourceString startingFrom: commentStart.	(commentStart ~= 0 and: [nextQuotePos >commentStart])] whileTrue: [		commentStart ~= nextQuotePos ifTrue: [			someComments add: ((sourceString copyFrom: commentStart + 1 to: nextQuotePos - 1) copyReplaceAll: '""' with: '"').].	aPos := nextQuotePos+1].	^someComments
