*SqClasses-documentationhowToModifyPrimitives	"You are allowed to write methods which specify primitives, but please use 	caution.  If you make a subclass of a class which contains a primitive method, 	the subclass inherits the primitive.  The message which is implemented 	primitively may be overridden in the subclass (E.g., see at:put: in String's 	subclass Symbol).  The primitive behavior can be invoked using super (see 	Symbol string:). 	 	A class which attempts to mimic the behavior of another class without being 	its subclass may or may not be able to use the primitives of the original class.  	In general, if the instance variables read or written by a primitive have the 	same meanings and are in the same fields in both classes, the primitive will 	work.  	For certain frequently used 'special selectors', the compiler emits a 	send-special-selector bytecode instead of a send-message bytecode. Special 	selectors were created because they offer two advantages.  First, code which	sends special selectors compiles into fewer bytes than normal. Second, for	some pairs of receiver classes and special selectors, the interpreter jumps	directly to a primitive routine without looking up the method in the class,	and the just-in-time (JIT) compiler (if in use) may emit code to directly execute	the primitive.  At least in the interpeeter this is much faster than a normal	message lookup. In both the interpreter and the JIT send-special-selector,	conditional branch pairs are short-circuited for the comparison selectors.	 	A selector which is a special selector solely in order to save space has a 	normal behavior.  Methods whose selectors are special in order to 	gain speed contain the comment, 'No Lookup'.  When the interpreter 	encounters a send-special-selector bytecode, it checks the class of the 	receiver and the selector.  If the class-selector pair is a no-lookup pair, 	then the interpreter swiftly jumps to the routine which implements the 	corresponding primitive.  (A special selector whose receiver is not of the 	right class to make a no-lookup pair, is looked up normally).  The pairs are 	listed below.  No-lookup methods contain a primitive number specification, 	<primitive: xx>, which is redundant.  Since the method is not normally looked 	up, deleting the primitive number specification cannot prevent this 	primitive from running.  If a no-lookup primitive fails, the method is looked 	up normally, and the expressions in it are executed. 	 	No Lookup pairs of (class, selector) 	SmallInteger and Float with any of	+ - * /	SmallInteger with any of			\  bitOr: bitShift: bitAnd:  // @	SmallInteger and Float with any of	=  ~=  >  <  >=  <= 	Any class with						== ~~ class	Point with either of					x y				(interpreter only)	BlockClosure with either of 			value value:	(interpreter only)	"	self error: 'comment only'
