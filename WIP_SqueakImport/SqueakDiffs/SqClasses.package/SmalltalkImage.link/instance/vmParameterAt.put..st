*SqClasses-*SqClasses-*SqClasses-vm parametersvmParameterAt: parameterIndex put: newValue	"parameterIndex is a positive integer corresponding to one of the VM's internal	parameter/metric registers.  Store newValue (a positive integer) into that	register and answer with the previous value that was stored there.	Fail if newValue is out of range, if parameterIndex has no corresponding	register, or if the corresponding register is read-only.	As of mid 2017 the parameters which can be set are		5	allocations between GCs (read-write; nil in Cog VMs)		6	survivor count tenuring threshold (read-write)		17	proportion of code zone available for use (Sista VMs only)		23	bytes of extra memory to reserve for VM buffers, plugins, etc.		24	memory threshold above whichto shrink object memory (read-write)		25	memory headroom when growing object memory (read-write)		26	interruptChecksEveryNms - force an ioProcessEvents every N milliseconds (read-write)		34	bytes allocated in total since start-up or reset (read-write)		43	desired number of stack pages (stored in image file header, max 65535; Cog VMs only, otherwise nil)		45	desired size of eden, in bytes (stored in image file header; Cog VMs only, otherwise nil)		47	desired size of machine code zone, in bytes (applies at startup only, stored in image file header; Cog JIT VM only)		48	various properties of the Cog VM as an integer encoding an array of bit flags.			Bit 0: tells the VM that the image's Process class has threadId as its 5th inst var (after nextLink, suspendedContext, priority & myList)			Bit 1: on Cog JIT VMs asks the VM to set the flag bit in interpreted methods			Bit 2: if set, preempting a process puts it to the head of its run queue, not the back,					i.e. preempting a process by a higher priority one will not cause the preempted process to yield						to others at the same priority.			Bit 3: in a muilt-threaded VM, if set, the Window system will only be accessed from the first VM thread			Bit 4: in a Spur vm, if set, causes weaklings and ephemerons to be queued individually for finalization		49	the size of the external semaphore table (read-write; Cog VMs only)		55	ratio of growth and image size at or above which a GC will be performed post scavenge (Spur only, otherwise nil)		67	the maximum allowed size of old space in bytes, 0 implies no internal limit (Spur only)."		self primitiveFailed
