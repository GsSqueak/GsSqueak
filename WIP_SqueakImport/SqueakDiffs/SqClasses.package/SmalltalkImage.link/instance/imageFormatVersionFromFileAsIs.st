The image version number may	identify the format of the image (e.g. 32 or 64-bit word size) or specific requirements	of the image (e.g. block closure support required). If the image file has a different	endianness than the VM, the format version will appear byte-swapped."	"Smalltalk image imageFormatVersionFromFileAsIs"	^(FileStream readOnlyFileNamed: Smalltalk imageName do: [ :file | file binary; next: 4 ])		unsignedLongAt: 1 bigEndian: Smalltalk isBigEndian
