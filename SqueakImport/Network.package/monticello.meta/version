Not sure exactly if this has caused an actual bug yet, but I agree it is a good idea to not share.- Fix bug in FileUrl>>pathForDirectory which used an explicit pathname delimiter in one place. Duh.- Removed class MswUrl, sorry but this should not be in standard Network package IMHO. There is no use of it in the current image.Non behavior changes:- Refactoring adding Url class>>urlClassForScheme:.- Improved naming in ServerDirectory class>>serverForURL:, no actual code change.- Refines and adds lots of comments here and there.Differences from proposed changes from Bernard Pieber in Mantis #861:- Did not include the proposed HierarchicalPath>>pathForDirectory because it doesn''t return a path (like the same method in FileUrl does), instead it returns a URL turned into a String. I changed the few senders that Bernard Pieber (Mantis #861) introduced to "directoryUrl asString" instead.- Did not add isSuperSwikiUrl, it does not belong there. It is a hack from the start.Network-KLC.19:This is an adaptation of the updated provided by Patrick Mauritz at Mantis ID #0411:"Change Set: Enh-ConnectionQueueDate: 16 October 2004Author: Patrick MauritzAllow classes to subscribe to the ConnectionQueue via addDependent: to get notifications when new connections are opened.Receivers need to implement update:aSocket for this to work.Thanks to Ken Causey for guidance on IRC."I adapted Patrick''s changes to ConnectionQueue>>listenLoop the result being that a check for a ConnectedTimedOut exception is added and a call to self changed on successful connection. Otherwise this should be the same as previously in the image.Network-KLC.20:As reported in Mantis ID #2106 this method included a call to the now non-existent Notification class>deprecated method. I''ve replaced that call. With what I think is the appropriate mechanism.The next question is at what point do deprecated methods get removed entirely?Network-KLC.21:This removes 3 methods that had no implementation other than calls to self halt. None of the 3 methods were being used and it didn''t appear that they would likely ever be used.Network-gk.23:Fix for Mantis #2119, the simplest one described.Fix for Mantis #1585, moved 3 test methods from OldSocket class to Socket and updated the code so that it works.Doing the above I also fixed an issue inSocket>>waitForDisconnectionFor:, it was wrongly waiting on "semaphore" instead of "self readSemaphore".

Not sure exactly if this has caused an actual bug yet, but I agree it is a good idea to not share.- Fix bug in FileUrl>>pathForDirectory which used an explicit pathname delimiter in one place. Duh.- Removed class MswUrl, sorry but this should not be in standard Network package IMHO. There is no use of it in the current image.Non behavior changes:- Refactoring adding Url class>>urlClassForScheme:.- Improved naming in ServerDirectory class>>serverForURL:, no actual code change.- Refines and adds lots of comments here and there.Differences from proposed changes from Bernard Pieber in Mantis #861:- Did not include the proposed HierarchicalPath>>pathForDirectory because it doesn''t return a path (like the same method in FileUrl does), instead it returns a URL turned into a String.
