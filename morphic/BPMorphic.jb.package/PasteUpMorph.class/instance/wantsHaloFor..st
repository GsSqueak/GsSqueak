wantsHaloFor: aSubMorph 	"Answer whether the receiver wishes for a mouse-over halo to be	produced for aSubMorph"	^ wantsMouseOverHalos == true		and: [self visible				and: [isPartsBin ~~ true						and: [self dropEnabled								and: [self isWorldMorph not										or: [aSubMorph renderedMorph isLikelyRecipientForMouseOverHalos]]]]			"The odd logic at the end of the above says...						* If we're an interior playfield, then if we're set up for			mouseover halos, show em.			* If we're a World that's set up for mouseover halos, only show			'em if the putative			recipient is a SketchMorph.						This (old) logic was put in to suit a particular need in early			e-toy days and seems rather strange now!"]
