filling
floodFill: aColor at: interiorPoint tolerance: tolerance 	"Fill the shape (4-connected) at interiorPoint. The algorithm is based	on Paul Heckbert's 'A Seed Fill Algorithm', Graphic Gems I, Academic	Press, 1990.	NOTE (ar): This variant has been heavily optimized to prevent the	overhead of repeated calls to BitBlt. Usually this is a really big winner	but the runtime now depends a bit on the complexity of the shape to	be filled. For extremely complex shapes (say, a Hilbert curve) with	very few pixels to fill it can be slower than #floodFill2:at: since it	needs to repeatedly read the source bits. However, in all practical	cases I found this variant to be 15-20 times faster than anything else.	Further note (di): I have added a feature that allows this routine to fill	areas of approximately constant color (such as photos, scans, and	jpegs). It does this by computing a color map for the peeker that	maps all colors close to 'old' into colors identical to old. This mild	colorblindness achieves the desired effect with no further change or	degradation of the algorithm. tolerance should be 0 (exact match), or	a value corresponding to those returned by Color>>diff:, with 0.1	being a reasonable starting choice."	| peeker poker stack old new x y top x1 x2 dy left goRight span spanBits w box debug |	debug := false.	"set it to true to see the filling process"	box := interiorPoint extent: 1 @ 1.	span := Form extent: width @ 1 depth: 32.	spanBits := span bits.	peeker := BitBlt toForm: span.	peeker sourceForm: self;		 combinationRule: 3;		 width: width;		 height: 1.	"read old pixel value"	peeker sourceOrigin: interiorPoint;		 destOrigin: interiorPoint x @ 0;		 width: 1;		 copyBits.	old := spanBits at: interiorPoint x + 1.	"compute new value (take care since the algorithm will fail if old =	new) "	new := self privateFloodFillValue: aColor.	old = new		ifTrue: [^ box].	tolerance > 0		ifTrue: ["Set up color map for approximate fills"			peeker				colorMap: (self						floodFillMapFrom: self						to: span						mappingColorsWithin: tolerance						to: old)].	poker := BitBlt toForm: self.	poker fillColor: aColor;		 combinationRule: 3;		 width: width;		 height: 1.	stack := OrderedCollection new: 50.	x := interiorPoint x.	y := interiorPoint y.	(y >= 0			and: [y < height])		ifTrue: [stack addLast: {y. x. x. 1}.			"y, left, right, dy"			stack addLast: {y + 1. x. x. -1}].	[stack isEmpty]		whileFalse: [debug				ifTrue: [self displayOn: Display].			top := stack removeLast.			y := top at: 1.			x1 := top at: 2.			x2 := top at: 3.			dy := top at: 4.			y := y + dy.			debug				ifTrue: [Display						drawLine: (Form extent: 1 @ 1 depth: 8) fillWhite						from: x1 - 1 @ y						to: x2 + 1 @ y						clippingBox: Display boundingBox						rule: Form over						fillColor: nil].			"Segment of scanline (y-dy) for x1 <= x <= x2 was previously			filled.
